This is the source for the LucidJ Documentation. It is organized as follows:

ifdef::env-github[]
[[include:docs/book-list]]
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
include::docs/book-list.adoc[]
endif::[]

The raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formatted files in the `docs/` directory.

== Prerequisites for Building

* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

== Building the Documentation Artifacts

By default, Ant will download and cache all needed tools, then invoke the `build-all` target. At this time, only the HTML rendering is implemented. The output of all builds will be located in `dist` directory.

For details on building the documentation, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available versions;
* `ant build-html`: builds only the HTML version;
* `ant clean`: removes the `dist` directory;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools.

== Key Directories

Key directories to be aware of:

* `docs` - where all human edited `*.adoc` files related to the documentation live, as well as various configuration, theme, and template files
* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars for the custom tasks and other tools
* `dist` - the generated artifacts, where:
** `dist/html` - HTML generated version of the documentation

== AsciiDoc Resources

We use AsciiDoc standard for all documentation. It's worth noticing, however, that we render all documentation with https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciiDoctorJ] and https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-ant[AsciiDoctor Ant] plugin.
