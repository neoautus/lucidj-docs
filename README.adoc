This is the source for the LucidJ Documentation.

Raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formatted files in the `docs/` directory.

== Prerequisites for Building

* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

== Building the Documentation Artifacts
For details on building the documentation, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available versions;
* `ant build-html`: builds only the HTML version;
* `ant clean`: removes the `dist` directory;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools.

The output of all builds will be located in `dist` directory.

== Key Directories
Key directories to be aware of:

* `docs` - where all human edited `*.adoc` files related to the documentation live, as well as various configuration, theme, and template files
* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars for the custom tasks and other tools
* `dist` - the generated artifacts, where:
** `dist/html` - HTML generated version of the documentation

See the additional documentation in `somewhere?` for more information about how to edit files, build for releases, or modifying any templates.
